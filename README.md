This repository contains all certified technologies used in Saagie.
It also contains some experimental technologies before being certified.

For information about using these technologies with your Saagie platform, refer to [Saagie's official documentation](https://docs.saagie.io/product/latest/sdk/index.html).

## CONTRIBUTING

All contributions are made via Github Pull Requests.

### Build

The build is using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)

Launch the Gradle task `localBuildModifiedJobs` or `localBuildModifiedApps` to build locally the technology modified locally:

    ./gradlew localBuildModifiedJobs
    ./gradlew localBuildModifiedApps

### CI

The build is running using a Github Action workflow (build only modified). It builds only technologies modified and generate a pre release containing assets. The name of the pre release = current version + name of the branch.

### Structure

The build is using the [Gradle plugin for Saagie technologies repository](https://github.com/saagie/technologies-plugin). It expects a specific directory structure:
- `technologies`: the required base directory. It contains sub directories for each type of technology metadata: 
-- `app`: contains folders of each app technology
-- `job`: contains folders of each job technology
-- `connectiontype`: contains folders of each connection type (deprecated)
-- `scripts` is a sub directory dedicated to external technologies which share the same javascript files (deprecated)

Each metadata folder must then contain a `metadata.yaml` file. For `job` and `app` technology metadata, the build is automatically generating them from the `technology.yaml` file and each `context.yaml` found in the sub folders.

NOTE: Generated files (metadata.yaml, js files, etc..) need to be checked in git, since the build is trying to avoid rebuilding technologies which didn't change.

#### Docker based technologies

For each context of a job (non external, based on an Docker image) or of an app technology, the folder dedicated to the context must then contain:
- `build.gradle.kts` which apply the `SaagieTechnologiesGradlePlugin` and the `DockerRemoteApiPlugin`. 
- `Dockerfile` which declares how to build the Docker image
- `image_test.yml`: if present, the generated Docker image will be tested with the [GoogleContainerTools/container-structure-test](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-structure-test)

#### External technologies

For contexts of an external job technology, the `context.yaml` file will reference javascript files, relatively to its location. The referenced javascript files should be generated by a dedicated javascript build.

The build of such javascript files can be setup anywhere in the directory structure, as long as the relative path is proprely filled in the `context.yaml` file.

The Saagie Gradle plugin can be used to trigger the build of the javascript file in the CI. It needs:
- a `build.gradle.kts` which apply the `SaagieTechnologiesGradlePlugin` and the `NodePlugin`.
- a `package.json` with a `build` and `test` scripts.

The Saagie Gradle plugin will launch [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install depednencies and run the scripts to build and test the javascript files.

### Developping an External Job Technology

It is highly recommended to use the [Saagie SDK](https://github.com/saagie/sdk) when developping an external job technology.

In technologies which doesn't share scripts with other technologies, it should be already setup. For instance, in the technology folder of `dataiku`, just run `yarn dev` and the build of the javascript files will be running with the watch mode, and the SDK webapp will start.

For technologies which share javascript files, like `aws`, `gcp` or `azure`, the setup is split in two parts. In the folder dedicated to the shared scripts, run `yarn dev` to run the build with the watch mode. Then in the folder dedicated to the technology to develop, like `aws-lambda`, run `npx @saagie/sdk start` to start the SDK webapp.

### Promotion

When the pull-request is merged in master, another Github action (running a gradle task) starts. It will retag docker images with branch name into a "production" name and generate a real release (and delete the pre release)
